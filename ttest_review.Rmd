```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = beaver1,
                 aes(x = temp),
                 fill = "blue") +
  geom_histogram(data = beaver2,
                 aes(x = temp), 
                 fill = "green",
                 alpha = 0.5)

ggplot()+
  geom_qq(data = beaver1, aes(sample = temp))
```

Is there a significant difference in mean body tmeperature for beaver 1 and beaver 2?

Use a t-test. Two-tailed test (no directionality implied)
```{r}
my_ttest <- t.test(beaver1$temp, beaver2$temp)

my_ttest
```

Mean body temperature for beaver 1 (`r round(my_ttest$estimate[1],2)`)
